The link to the HTML page for HW03 can be found [here](https://stat545-ubc-hw-2019-20.github.io/stat545-hw-SaelinB/HW03/HW03.html)

I also attempted to do two columns as part of the optional extra credit, but it doesn't look super nice. That can be found [here](https://stat545-ubc-hw-2019-20.github.io/stat545-hw-SaelinB/HW03/HW03_2ColumnAttempt.html)
