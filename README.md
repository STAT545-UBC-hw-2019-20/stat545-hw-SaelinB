# About this Repo

Welcome to my STAT 545 participation repo

This respository was made for storing STAT 545 participiation files and homework. 
There is one only one branch, and everything done the first two weeks is stored in the folder Weeks_1_and_2. 

All upcoming homework assignments will be found in the STAT 545 github classroom, in [my homework repo](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/stat545-hw-SaelinB).

I'm taking STAT 545 to learn more about how to **explore** and *analyze* data!
