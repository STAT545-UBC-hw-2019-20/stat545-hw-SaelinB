```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

**Loading packages needed:**
```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(knitr)
```

**The Data:**
```{r}
DT::datatable(gapminder)
```



## Exercise 1

### Univariate Option 1:


**1.1 Make a tibble with one row per year, and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries**

```{r}
gapminder_wide <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("China", "Taiwan", "Japan")) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = country,
              values_from = lifeExp,
               id_cols = year )
kable(gapminder_wide)
```




**1.2 Shape a scatterplot to life expectancy for one country against that of another**

China's life expectancy increases nearly linearly with Japan's, with an exception being in 1957, where Japan's life expectancy rose while China's remained the same
```{r}
gapminder_wide %>%
  ggplot(aes(China, Japan, color = factor(year), size = 1.5)) + #use factor() to make year discrete 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy of China vs. Japan", subtitle = "From 1952 to 2007", color = "Year") +
  guides(size = FALSE) + #remove size legend
  theme_light()
```



**1.3 Re-lengthen the data**
```{r}
gapminder_long <- gapminder_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to ="Country",
               values_to = "Life Expectancy", 
                 cols = -year) 
DT::datatable(gapminder_long)
```





## Exercise 2

### Multivariate Option 2:

**2.1 Make a tibble with one row per year, and columns for life expectancy and GDP per capita for two or more countries**
```{r}
gap_multi_wide <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("China", "Taiwan", "Japan")) %>%
  rename(GDP_PerCap = gdpPercap, Life_Expectancy = lifeExp) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = year,
              names_from = country,
              values_from = c(GDP_PerCap, Life_Expectancy), 
              names_sep = " ")
kable(gap_multi_wide)
```




**2.2 Re-lengthen the data**
```{r}
gap_multi_long <- gap_multi_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -year,
               names_to = c("Metric","country"), 
               values_to= c("Measurement"),
               names_sep = " ")
DT::datatable(gap_multi_long)
  
```







## Exercise 3

Loading CSVs with guest and email info:
```{r, warning = F, message = F}
guest <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/data/wedding/attend.csv")
email <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/data/wedding/emails.csv")

```

**A look at the data:**
```{r, message = F}
DT::datatable(email)
DT::datatable(guest)
```


**3.1 For each guest in the guestlist (guest tibble), add a column for email address, which can be found in email table**

```{r, message = F }
emails <- email %>%  #modify email to make it "joinable"
  rename("name" = guest) %>%   #rename guest to name 
  separate_rows("name", sep =", ")  # seperate names within one cell into separate rows

DT::datatable(left_join(guest, emails))  # join the tables, adding email column to guest

```




**3.2 Who do we have emails for, yet are not on the guestlist?**

```{r, message = F}
emails <- email %>%  #modify email to make it "joinable"
  rename("name" = guest) %>%   #rename guest to name 
  separate_rows("name", sep =", ")  # seperate names within one cell into separate rows

kable(anti_join(emails, guest)) #filter-join the tables, keeping only rows in emails that aren't in guest

```





**3.3 Make a guestlist that includes everyone we have emails for (in addition to those on the original guestlist)**
```{r, message = F}
emails <- email %>%  #modify email to make it "joinable"
  rename("name" = guest) %>%   #rename guest to name 
  separate_rows("name", sep =", ")  # seperate names within one cell into separate rows

DT::datatable(full_join(guest,emails))


```
